# ft_rgb2hex
to convert color rgb to hexa we used a hex base 0123456789abcdef and for each color we divide the number by 16 and the quotient corresponds to the first value of the color in hexa and the rest to the second one each of these two values is taken as an index of the hexa base cited above in the end we concatenate all the values in order and the result is the conversion of the three rgb values into hexadecimal
